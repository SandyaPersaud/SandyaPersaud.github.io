Superhero <span class="fill">'+answers[0]+'</span> swooped down, grabbed hold of her hands and flew them back to his secret hideout on <span class="fill">'+answers[5]+'</span> .He let her play with his <span class="fill">'+answers[6]+'</span> and together they ate lots of <span class="fill">'+answers[7]+'</span> and drank gallons of <span class="fill">'+answers[8]+'</span>. They watched <span class="fill">'+answers[9]+'</span> on television. Soon it was time to go and she stuffed her poket with <span class="fill">'+answers[10]+'</span> to eat on the way. Everyone was <span class="fill">'+answers[11]+'</span> and it was another successful mission for <span class="fill">'+answers[0]+'</span> .');
